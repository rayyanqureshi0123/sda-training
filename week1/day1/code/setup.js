## Sprint Goal
Establish development workflow and create foundation for advanced frontend development.

## User Stories

### Epic 1: Development Environment Setup
- [ ] **US-001**: As a developer, I want to set up Git workflow so that I can collaborate effectively
- [ ] **US-002**: As a developer, I want to create proper repository structure so that the project is organized
- [ ] **US-003**: As a developer, I want to establish branching strategy so that features can be developed independently

### Epic 2: Documentation Standards
- [ ] **US-004**: As a developer, I want to create PR templates so that code reviews are consistent
- [ ] **US-005**: As a developer, I want to document processes so that team members can follow best practices

## Acceptance Criteria
- Repository structure is established
- Branching strategy is implemented
- PR templates are created
- Documentation is comprehensive
- All tasks are committed with descriptive messages`
